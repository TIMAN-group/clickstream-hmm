# MOOC Clickstream Mining with Hidden Markov Mixtures of Markov Models

This project will contain the code used for mining Coursera clickstream
dumps using hidden Markov mixtures of Markov models.

## Requirements
- MeTA with `sequence::hidden_markov_model` (currently this means the `hmm`
  branch of MeTA)
- nlohmann/json for JSON parsing
